%   Filtering of nuclei done in three steps: 
% 1. An optional threshold on allowed min intensity at max.
% 2. A generous test for local max, that should not miss anything and
% also give not too many false +.  This is done by imreconstruction
% comparing mask = img + nucIntensityLoc, with dilation of img. Increase
% the nucIntensity local parameter to eliminate false +, decrease if
% missing real nuclei. All local max within a distance of minNucSep are
% merged.
% 3. A filter compares intensity at centroid of each local max with
% intensity in ring defined by radiusMin/Max and demands a contrast of at
% least nucIntensityRange. If loosing real nucs, decrease, if getting false
% positives, increase.
%   To adjust the two nucIntensity numbers, run with verbose=1 and look at
