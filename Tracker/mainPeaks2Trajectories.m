%
% take the peaks{} cell array with peaks{time} = xy_area(:,3), run AW MatchFrames() 
% to add 4th col onto peaks array with link to next cell in next frame, if necessary
% 
% Reformat the peaks{} data structure into a trajectory struct array.
% Then take all trajectories which end in a band of times and match, via
% minimimizing distance cost matrix, to traj with beginning times in a band
% This is done to remove marginal matches when a better one is available at
% a later time. The cost to match to a dummy cell is computed adaptively.
%
% There is a parameter to discard trajectories < min_length, and a param
% merge_gap parameter in mergeTrajectories() which defines the interval of
% traj ends and beg's that are grouped together. Merger for a traj ending
% at tend is allowed for any traj that begins in range [tend, tend+merge_gap]
% All numerical data is linearly interpolated when traj merger results in
% missing times.
% 
% An explicit boundary state is introduced, and the cost to go there is
% just the min distance. Currently 'boundary' is just limits of image, but
% could easily introduce actual image of CCC. However this state seems to
% minimally impact results.
%
% trajectory struct array is defined with fields:
%   beg     first time (int >=1 by defn)
%   end     last time
%   merge   row vector of [end, beg] times of trajectories merged or []
%   cells   list of (1,end-beg+1) cell numbers corresponding to x,y,area at given time
%   cells   = -1 for interpolated times, otherwise >0
%   x       list of end-beg+1 x positions copied from peaks{} or interpolated
%   y       ibid   NB all data row matrix, time==column number
%   area    nuclear area, copied from peaks or interpolated.
%   data    anything in cols 5:end of peaks{} organized as mtx(#data, times)
%
% TODO introduce size of img array into costMatrixEDS since needed to compute distances 
% to boundary. Currently set as userParam.sizeImg = [..] below, 
% could record in setUserParam*.m file

global userParam    % eventually may go to setUserParam fn, but this routine stand alone.

%%%%% params for cellTrackerEDS routines -> setUserParam*.m function.
%
% There is a first pass over the peaks{} array that does matching of adjacent
% frames following AW, using all his parameters. The peaks{} array is
% transformed into a trajectory struct array by stringing together cells
% matched between successive frames. These trajectories are them subject to
% further merger based on a new cost matrix that sets the cost of matching
% to dummy based on actual statistics of distance moved per frame, and
% introduces a boundary state for which cost of match is distance to bndry.
%   There are parameters to discard trajectories < min_length. Trajectory
% merger is done by considering a band of loose ends [time, time+mergeGap]
% and computing cost matrix between all of them and a equal size band of
% loose trajectory beginnings. Merger is allowed for t_end < t_beg - 1, in
% which case x,y,area data is interpolated.
